# A more systematic and advanced approach to prototype research ideas

This repository contains an easy-to-use and easy-to-follow heirarchy of code base :octocat: that aids in fast prototyping Machine Learning research ideas. Internally, the code base relies on tensorflow framework, but same coding style can be incorporated with any ML library such as py-torch and caffe. Each file in this project has been written by keeping one thing in mind: **multiple experimentations with several revisions of ML models and several revisions of hyper-parameters**. Thus, this code-base is an intial step to manage the experiments in a more systematic way and track the multiple result output with ample amount of variations and visualizations. :muscle:

# Some key features
1. Bayesian optimizer for hyper-parameter search before you start your training.
2. Inclusion of ready to use popular dataset processing scripts (such as MNIST, CIFAR, IMAGENET).
3. Takes full advange of tensorflow fast data pipeline and efficient GPU computation algorithms.
4. Get the notifications of the training progress on your mobile-phone.
5. Highly extensible and easy to modify source code.
6. Extensive guide and comments through out the project to guide about the implementation of a new feature
7. Interesting visualizations such as distribution plot of an intermediate layer of neural network

# Up coming features
1. Support for training detection models, with more modularity.

## Dependency
`numpy` `ntfy` `slackclient` `ntfy[slack]` `tensorflow` or `tensorflow_gpu` `keyboard` `opencv_python` `netron` `wget` `pathlib` `statistics` `argparse` `scikit-optimize` `matplotlib` `scipy` `Pillow` `six`

Tested on python version 2 and 3
All packages can be updated/installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt` except `ntfy[slack]`. Install `ntfy[slack]` seperately with `pip install ntfy[slack]` post requirements.txt installation.

## About the code-base
The main controller is *master.py*. There are two parts which needs further explaination.
* How to use this framework in your own project.
* Where should you make changes.

## How to make use of it.
Fork the whole repository or make a copy of it. In order to remain updated, :star2::star2:**star mark this repository**:star2::star2:, and you will be notified :calling: about the newer versions. Install the requirements and update the dependencies as described in requirements.txt file.

Once the repository is being copied :floppy_disk:, interact **only** with *master.py*.
"master.py" is the main controller and it handles following:
* **Phase 1:** Get ready with benchmark dataset(s)
    * Dataset download
    * Data pre-processing
    * Data provider as required in training phase.
* **Phase 2:** Declararing the architecture(s) and training detail(s)
    * Model architecture design
    * Hyper-parameter settings
    * Setup intermediate results saving infrastructure
* **Phase 3:** Training and evaluation
    * Training
    * Testing and setting visualization infrastructure
* **Phase 4:** Record results
    * Create tabular results
    * Visualization

### Options for *master.py*

* Dataset Phase options
> python master.py --phase "dataset" --dataset "CIFAR-10" --download True --preprocess True

* Training Phase options
> python master.py --phase "train" --dataset "CIFAR-10" --model 1 --param 1

* Evaluation Phase options
> python master.py --phase "evaluate" --dataset "CIFAR-10" --model 1 --param 1

* Visualization options
> python master.py --phase "visualize" --model 1 --param 1

* No Option - Default - Runs through all of the above phases
* downloads and preprocess the default MNIST datase, trains on a default LeNet architecture, evalute the training and save the visualizations
> python master.py

## Where to make changes
* dataset/*dataset_name*/dataset_script.py
```
Here, define the methods to retrive, download and process the dataset.
Two folders namely raw and pre-processed shall be used for any pre-processing.
Do not change getter function name and class signature
```

* dataset/*dataset_name*/dataset_provider.py
```
Must define atleast two functions namely set_batch(batch_size) and next()
Do not change getter function name and class signature
```

* architecture/version_x/model.py
```
Define the architecture in build function.
Do not change anything else.
For a new model, a new folder with a incremental version number
should be created.
```

* core/model_trainer.py
```
Make changes to get_data_provider() function. Change code only inside
session of execute() function
```

* core/generate_visualization.py
```
Make changes to get_model() function only.
```

* hyperparameter/version_x/param
```
Modify param.json file in a provided version folder or add a new verson
folder with param.json file.
```
